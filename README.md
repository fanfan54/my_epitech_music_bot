# my_epitech_music_bot
My first Discord bot, written in Python using discord.py! It can play a given playlist on your server, or any other song from YouTube.

**Work in progress!**

I followed the instructions from [@MaximeHouis](https://github.com/MaximeHouis), speaker at a Hub Workshop about Discord bots, at EPITECH Paris.
